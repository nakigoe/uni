<h2>Onlin Round Table with Russia and Malaysia, My List of Questions</h2>

•	Constructive business is only possible when there is peace. What is the best way to the peaceful conditions, in Your opinion?

•	I want to start an IT firm in Russia. How would You recommend to start my IT business in today’s Russia and to make money?

•	Many foreigners ask me what do I think of Putin. Do You wish to know an answer to that question too?

•	We are running out of Russia. What on earth did You forget here?

•	What is your salary?

•	I had my English high-school exam grades cut twice by the Russian examinators without reason. What would you do if you were at my place?

•	What do you think of religious persecution, elimination of freedom, human rights violation and army conscription?

•	What do you think of Russian voting system and changes to the constitution and laws?

•	I do not really care about social business in our prison-country in our impoverished university. And we are called economists. Yey! Social business. What’s in it for me?

•	Our computers are 10 years old. And we are meant to be the programmers who run this country’s economics. What is Your opinion on university funding, military, and corruption?

•	Our prices have risen 2-3 fold, but my hourly rate as a private tutor dropped 20%. I cannot understand why we are all sitting here. Could you please explain?
